Detecting Spam Emails Using Tensorflow in Python
In this article, we’ll build a TensorFlow-based Spam detector; in simpler terms, we will have to classify the texts as Spam or Ham. This implies that Spam detection is a case of a Text Classification problem. So, we’ll be performing EDA on our dataset and building a text classification model.

Importing Libraries
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn/Wordcloud– This library is used to draw visualizations.
NLTK – Natural Language Tool Kit provides various functions to process the raw textual data.
